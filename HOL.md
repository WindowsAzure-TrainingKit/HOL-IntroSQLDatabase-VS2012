<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##

SQL Database makes the power of Microsoft SQL Server available in a Cloud Hosted offering. Working with SQL Database should be a familiar experience for most developers because, for the most part, it supports the same tooling and development practices currently used for on premises SQL Server applications.

This hands-on lab will walk through a series of simple use cases for SQL Database such as provisioning your account, creating, and using a database. You will create a simple Windows Azure application to allow you to manipulate the data in the Contact table of a database running in SQL Database.

<a name="Objectives"></a>
### Objectives ###

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to:

-	Use SQL Database as a cloud hosted database platform for your applications.

## Exercises ##

This hands-on lab includes the following exercises:

1. [Preparing Your SQL Database Account](#Exercise1)
1. [Basic DDL and DML - Creating Tables and Indexes](#Exercise2)
1. [Build a Windows Azure Application that Accesses SQL Database](#Exercise3)
1. [Connecting via Client Libraries](#Exercise4)

Estimated time to complete this lab: **60 minutes**.

> **Note:** When you first start Visual Studio, you must select one of the predefined settings collections. Every predefined collection is designed to match a particular development style and determines window layouts, editor behavior, IntelliSense code snippets, and dialog box options. The procedures in this lab describe the actions necessary to accomplish a given task in Visual Studio when using the **General Development Settings** collection. If you choose a different settings collection for your development environment, there may be differences in these procedures that you need to take into account.

<a name="Exercise1"></a>
### Exercise 1: Preparing Your SQL Database Account ###

In this exercise, you will connect to your SQL Database account and create a database server, add a new user and then reconnect to SQL Database so that you can begin working with your new database.

<a name="Ex1Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 - Retrieving your SQL Database Server Name ####
In this task, you will log into the SQL Database portal to obtain the name of the SQL Database server assigned to your account.

1. Open **Internet Explorer** and navigate to the Windows Azure portal at [https://manage.windowsazure.com](https://manage.windowsazure.com).

1. Log in to your Microsoft account.

	![LoggingIntoTheAzureServicesPortal](Images/loggingintotheazureservicesportal.png?raw=true)

	_Logging into the Azure Services Portal_

1. At the Windows Azure portal home page, click **SQL Databases** from the left pane, and select **Servers** to list your SQL servers.
	
	 ![Viewing SQL Servers](Images/viewing-sql-servers.png?raw=true)

	_Viewing SQL Servers_ 

1. If you have not previously created a server, you will need to do so now; otherwise, you may skip this exercise. 

1. To create a new server, click **Add** in the bottom menu.
	 
	![Add a new SQL Server](Images/add-a-new-sql-server.png?raw=true "Add a new SQL Server")

	_Add a new SQL Server_ 

1. Insert an **Admin Name** (e.g. SQLAdmin) and a **Password** for the database administrator. Select a **Region** where the server database will be created. Ensure **Allow Windows Azure Services to access the server** is checked, and click **Tick** to create the new server. You will configure firewall rules later on this exercise.
	 
	![Server settings](Images/server-settings.png?raw=true)

	_Server settings_
	
	>**Note:** An administrator account is a master account used to manage the new server. You should avoid using this account in connection strings where the username and password may be exposed.
	>The password policy requires that the password follow certain rules.
	>
	>![PasswordPolicy](Images/passwordpolicy.png?raw=true)

1. Finally, the new server information, including **Fully Qualified Server Name**, is shown. 

	![SQL Database server list](Images/sqldatabaseserverlist.png?raw=true)

	_SQL Database server list_ 

	>**Note:** The fully qualified domain name of the server uses the following format:
     _\<ServerName\>.database.windows.net_ where _\<ServerName\>_ identifies the server, for example, _udi4slmm7g.database.windows.net_.
 
1. Click on your server name from the list of SQL servers created, and select **Dashboard** from the top menu. Review the information displayed from your SQL Server.

	![SQL Server Information Page](Images/sql-server-information-page.png?raw=true "SQL Server Information Page")

	_SQL Server Information Page_

1. Click **Configure** from the top menu to setup firewall rules for the server.
	 
	![SQL Server allowed IP addresses](Images/sql-database-server-allowed-ip-addresses.png?raw=true)

	_SQL Database server information page_ 

	>**Note:** The **allowed ip addresses** allows you to specify a list of IP addresses that can access your SQL Database Server. The firewall will deny all connections by default, so **be sure to configure your allow list** so that existing clients can connect to the server.

1. Click on **Add to allowed IP addresses** to allow yourself access the server. In **Windows Azure Services** make sure that _YES_ is selected to allow Azure accessing your SQL Server, and then click **Save**.
	
	![Adding a new Allowed IP](Images/adding-new-allowed-ip.png?raw=true)

	_Adding a new Allowed IP_
	
	>**Note:** Changes to your firewall settings can take some time to become effective.

	You now have a database server created and ready for the next steps in this lab. This database can be connected to from anywhere in the world.

<a name="Exercise2"></a>
### Exercise 2: Working with Data Basic DDL and DML ###

In this exercise, you will create a new database and work with its data. This means you will create some tables, index those tables appropriately, and then insert and query data. For this purpose, you will use two different tools. The first tool, the Database Manager for SQL Database, is a browser based Silverlight database administration tool that you can access from the Windows Azure portal. The other tool is SQL Server Management Studio, a tool normally associated with SQL Server management. You will see that this tool is equally useful for managing your SQL Databases.

<a name="Ex2Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 - Creating a New Database ####

1. In the Windows Azure Management portal UI, select **New** from the bottom pane, **Data Services** | **SQL Database** | **Custom Create**.
	
	![New SQL Database](Images/new-sql-database.png?raw=true)

	_Creating a new database_  

1. In the **Specify database settings** dialog, set the **Name** to _HoLTestDB_, select the _Web_ **Edition**, leave the **Limit database size** and **Collation** values with the suggested values, and select the **Server** you created in the previous exercise.
	 
	![ChoosingDatabaseFeatures](Images/new-database-settings.png?raw=true)

	_New database's features_
	
	>**Note:** In this hands-on lab, you create a database using the Windows Azure portal. Databases can also be created by executing a DDL query against your assigned server using the T-SQL CREATE DATABASE statement, specifying which SQL Database edition (Web or Business) to create as well as its maximum size. For example, to create a Business Edition database with a maximum size of 30GB, use the following T-SQL command: 
	>
	>**CREATE DATABASE HolTestDB (MAXSIZE = 30GB)** 
	>
	>Once a database reaches its maximum size, you cannot insert additional data until you delete some data to free storage space or increase its maximum size.

<a name="Ex2Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 - Managing your Database with the Database Manager for SQL Database ####

In this task, you use the Database Manager for SQL Database, a Silverlight client that runs in your browser, to connect to your SQL Database, create and populate a table, and then query its contents.

1. In the Windows Azure Management portal UI Home Page, select **SQL Databases** from the left pane, select _HoLTestDB_ database and click **Manage** on the bottom pane.
	 
	![Managing a Database](Images/manage-database.png?raw=true)

	_Managing a database_ 

1. You will be redirected to the **SQL Database Management Portal**. Enter your Server Administrator username and password and then click **Log on**.

	![SigningSQLDatabaseManagementPortal](Images/signingsqldatabasemanagementportal.png?raw=true)

	_Signing in to the SQL Database Management Portal_ 

1. Wait until you are connected to your database and the **Administration** page is shown.

1. Select the **HoLTestDB** database on the left pane.

	![SQLDatabaseManagementPortalAdministrationPage](Images/sqldatabasemanagementportaladministrationpage.png?raw=true)

	_SQL Database Management Portal Administration page_ 


1. On the left pane, click **Design** option.
	 
	![SQLDatabaseDesignView](Images/sqldatabasedesignview.png?raw=true)
  
	_SQL Database Design view_ 

1. Make sure **Tables** option is selected in the navigation menu and click **New table**.
	 
	![CreatingNewTable](Images/creatingnewtable.png?raw=true)

	_Creating a new table_

1. In the table creation UI, set the **Name** of the table to _People_. 

1. Next, define three table columns using the information shown below and click **Save**.

	| **Column** | **Type** | **Is Identity?** | **Is Required?** | **Is Primary Key?** |
	|------------|----------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|
	|ID          |Int       |Yes               |Yes               |Yes                  |
	|Name        |nvarchar(50)       |No               |Yes               |No                  |
	|Age         |Int       |No               |Yes               |No                  |

1. Once you finished adding sample data, click **Save** to commit the data to the table.
	 
	![SavingData](Images/savingdata.png?raw=true)

	_Saving Data_

1. Next, click **New Query** in the ribbon.
1. In the query window, enter the following T-SQL statement to select all the rows in the _People_ table and then click **Run**. Verify that the results grid shows the rows that you entered previously.
	
	````T-SQL
	select * from People
	````
	![QueryingDatabase](Images/queryingdatabase.png?raw=true)

	_Querying the database_

<a name="Ex2Task3"></a>
#### Task 3 - Managing your Database with SQL Server Management Studio ####
In this task, you use SQL Server Management Studio, a tool typically used for managing SQL Server, to connect to your SQL Database server and administer it.

1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio**. You will be presented with a logon dialog.

1. In the **Connect to Server** dialog, enter your login information ensuring that you select **SQL Server Authentication**. SQL Database currently only supports SQL Server Authentication. 
	
	![ConnectingSQLDatabaseSSMS](Images/connectingsqldatabasessms.png?raw=true)

	_Connecting to SQL Database with SQL Server Management Studio_ 
1. Click **Connect**.
1. You should now see in your **Object Explorer** the structure of your database. Notice that your SQL Database is no different to an on-premises relational database.

	![ObjectExplorerShowingDatabase](Images/objectexplorershowingdatabase.png?raw=true)

	_Object Explorer showing the HoLTestDB database_ 

1. In Object Explorer, select the **HoLTestDB** database in the tree view and then click **New Query** on the toolbar.
	   
	![CreatingNewQueryWindow](Images/creatingnewquerywindow.png?raw=true)

	_Creating a new query window_ 

1. You now have a query window with an active connection to your account. You can test your connection by displaying the result of the **@@version** scalar function. To do this, type the following statement into the query window and press the **Execute** button. You will get back a scalar result that indicates the edition as Microsoft SQL Database.
	
	````T-SQL
	SELECT @@version
	````
	 
	![RetrievingSQLDatabaseVersion](Images/retrievingsqlazureversion.png?raw=true)

	_Retrieving the SQL Database version_ 

1. Replace the previous query with the statement shown below and click **Execute.** Notice that the results grid shows the databases currently accessible.
	
	````T-SQL
	SELECT * FROM sys.databases
	````
	![QueryResultsShwoingListDatabases](Images/queryresultsshwoinglistdatabases.png?raw=true)

	_Query results showing the list of databases in your subscription_

1. You can check that you are now in the context of your user database by executing the following query. Make sure that you replace the previous query.
	
	````T-SQL
	SELECT db_name()
	````
	![QueryingDatabaseCurrentlyUse](Images/queryingdatabasecurrentlyuse.png?raw=true)
 
	_Querying the database currently in use_ 

1. Do not close the query window. You will need it during the next task.

<a name="Ex2Task4"></a>
#### Task 4 - Creating Logins and Database Users ####
Much like SQL Server, SQL Database allows you to create additional logins and then assign those logins as users with permissions on a database. In this task, you will create a new login and then create a user that uses the new login in your _HoLTestDB_ database.

1. Open a new query window connected to the _master_ database. To do this, in **Object Explorer**, expand the **System Databases** node inside **Databases** and then select _master_. Then, click **New Query** on the toolbar.
	 
	![QueryingMasterDatabase](Images/queryingmasterdatabase.png?raw=true)

	_Querying the master database_ 

	>**Note:** You cannot reuse the previous query window connected to the _HoLTestDB_ database because you cannot change the database context without closing the current connection. The USE \<database\_name\> command does not work with SQL Database. Therefore, you need to open a new query window or disconnect and reconnect in order to change from the _HoLTestDB_ to the _master_ database. 

1. Create a new login by executing the following statement:
	
	<!-- mark: 1 -->
	````SQL
	CREATE LOGIN HoLUser WITH password='Password1'
	````	

	>**Note:** You should choose your own password for this login account and use it where appropriate throughout the lab. If you do not choose a unique password, you should ensure that you remove this login when you finish the lab. To do this, execute the following statement in the _master_ database:
	>
	>**DROP LOGIN HoLUser** 

1. Go back to the query window connected to the _HoLTestDB_ database. If you closed this window, open it again by selecting the _HoLTestDB_ database in **Object Explorer** and then click **New Query**. 
1. In the query window, execute the following statement to create a new user in the HoLTestDB database for the login _HoLUser_.
	
	<!-- mark: 1-2 -->
	````SQL
	-- Create a new user from the login and execute
	CREATE USER HoLUser FROM LOGIN HoLUser
	````

1. Next, add the user to the **db_owner** role of your _HoLTestDB_ database by executing the following:
	
	<!-- mark: 1-2 -->
	````SQL
	-- Add the new user to the db_owner role and execute
	EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_owner', 'HoLUser'
	````

	>**Note:** By making your user a member of the **db_owner** role, you have granted a very extensive permission set to the user. In a real world scenario, you should be careful to ensure that you grant users only the smallest privilege set possible.
 
1. Change the user associated with the current connection to the newly created _HoLUser_. To do this, right-click the query window, point to **Connection**, and then select **Change Connection**.
	 
	![ChangingDatabaseConnectionProperties](Images/changingdatabaseconnectionproperties.png?raw=true)

	_Changing the database connection properties_

1. In the **Connect to Database Engine** dialog, replace the **Login** name with _HoLUser_ and set the **Password** to the value that you chose earlier when you created the database user.
	 
	![ConnectingDatabaseDifferentUser](Images/connectingdatabasedifferentuser.png?raw=true)

	_Connecting to the database as a different user_

1. Click **Options** to show additional connection settings. Switch to the **Connection Properties** tab and ensure that the name of the database for the connection is _HoLTestDB_. If the current value is different, you will need to type this rather than use the drop down list, then press the **Connect** button.
	 
	![ConnectingSpecificDatabase](Images/connectingspecificdatabase.png?raw=true)

	_Connecting to a specific database_ 
	
	>**Note:** You are now connected to the database as the _HoLUser_ database user. You will continue with this user for the remaining steps of this exercise.

<a name="Ex2Task5"></a>
#### Task 5 - Creating Tables, Indices, and Queries ####
1. In the query window, replace the current content with the following SQL query to create a _Contact_ table and execute it.
	
	<!-- mark: 1-9 -->
	````SQL
	CREATE TABLE [Contact](
	    [ContactID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED,
	    [Title] [nvarchar](8) NULL,
	    [FirstName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
	    [LastName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
	    [EmailAddress] [nvarchar](50) NULL,
	    [Phone] [nvarchar](30) NULL,
	    [Timestamp] [timestamp] NOT NULL
	)
	````
	
	>**Note:** SQL Database requires that every table has a clustered index. If you create a table without a clustered index, you will not be able to insert rows into the table until you have created one.
	Because the clustered index determines the order of rows on disk, and thus affects certain queries, you may choose to place the clustered index on a column other than the primary key column.
	
1. You will add an index on the _EmailAddress_ field. To do this, execute the following query:
	
	<!-- mark: 1-2 -->
	````SQL
	CREATE INDEX IX_Contact_EmailAddress
	    ON Contact(EmailAddress)
	````
	
1. Execute the following query to add a row to the new _Contact_ table:
	
	<!-- mark: 1-4 -->
	````SQL
	INSERT INTO [Contact]
	([Title],[FirstName],[LastName],[EmailAddress],[Phone])
	     VALUES
	('Mr','David','Alexander','davida@fabrikam.com','555-1234-5555')
	````
	
1. Now, query the data back out, but start by enabling the SHOWPLAN_ALL option to show the execution plan. To do that, execute the following query:
	
	<!-- mark: 1-5 -->
	```` SQL
	SET SHOWPLAN_ALL ON
	GO
	SELECT * FROM Contact WHERE EmailAddress ='davida@fabrikam.com'
	GO
	SET SHOWPLAN_ALL OFF
	````	
	![QueryExecutionPlanSmallSet](Images/queryexecutionplansmallset.png?raw=true)

	_Query execution plan for a small set_ 

1. Next, you will add a large number of rows to the database and then examine the query plan again. To do this, execute the following query to create a stored procedure named _AddData_. This stored procedure will loop incrementing a counter each time through and add a new record with an email address with the pattern [Counter]davida@fabrikam.com:
	
	<!-- mark: 1-13 -->
	````SQL
	CREATE PROCEDURE AddData
	@NumRows int
	AS
	DECLARE @counter int
	SELECT @counter = 1
	WHILE (@counter < @NumRows)
	BEGIN
	    INSERT INTO [Contact]
	        ([Title],[FirstName],[LastName],[EmailAddress],[Phone])
	        VALUES
	        ('Mr','David','Alexander',CAST(@counter as nvarchar)+'davida@fabrikam.com','555-1234-5555')
	        SELECT @counter = @counter + 1
	END
	````
	
1. Now, insert 10,000 rows into the _Contact_ table by executing the new stored procedure. Each row will have a unique email address. To do this, execute the following T-SQL statement:
	
	<!-- mark: 1 -->
	````SQL
	EXEC AddData 10000
	````
	
	>**Note:** It may take some time to generate the 10,000 rows.
	
1. Execute the following query again and examine the generated plan. Compare the result with the one obtained previously, when the table contained few rows.
	
	<!-- mark: 1-5 -->
	````SQL
	SET SHOWPLAN_ALL ON
	GO
	SELECT * FROM Contact WHERE EmailAddress ='davida@fabrikam.com'
	GO
	SET SHOWPLAN_ALL OFF
	````
	
	![QueryExecutionPlanLargeSet](Images/queryexecutionplanlargeset.png?raw=true)

	_Query execution plan for a large set_ 
	
	>**Note:** Notice that the second time around the query optimizer is likely to use the index that you defined: This is the Index Seek line in the query plan.
	
1. For the most part, you can use any tool that you might have previously used with SQL Server on-premises. For an example of this, look at the query plan graphically. In SQL Server Management Studio, press **Ctrl-L** to display the **Estimated Execution Plan**.
	 
	![ShowingQueryExecutionPlanGraphically](Images/showingqueryexecutionplangraphically.png?raw=true)

### Exercise 3: Build a Windows Azure Application that Accesses SQL Database ###

In this exercise, you will create a simple Windows Azure application to manipulate the data in the _Customer_ table of the _AdventureWorksLT2008_ database.

The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate just how simple it is to work with SQL Database and Windows Azure using the graphical Visual Studio 'drag and drop' approach.

<a name="Ex3Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 - Loading the Sample Database into SQL Database ####

1. Connect to the _HoLTestDB_ database on your SQL Database server using the _HoLUser_ login that you created in the previous exercises. You can use either SQL Server Management Studio or the Database Manager for SQL Database to perform these steps.
1. If you are using SQL Server Management Studio, in the **File** menu, select **Open** | **File** and then navigate to the **Assets** folder inside the **Source** folder of this lab; if you use the Database Manager for SQL Database, select the **Database** context on the upper left corner and click the **Open Query** button in the **File** group. Select the **AdventureWorks2008LT_Azure.sql** file and click **Open**.
	
	>**Note:** This script contains a cleaned up export script from the _AdventureWorksLT2008_ sample database available for download in the [Codeplex sample databases project site](http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/). 

1. Execute the query. This may take a few minutes, as you are creating a subset of the Adventure Works database.

<a name="Ex3Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 - Creating the Visual Studio Project ####
In this task, you create a new Visual Studio project for a Windows Azure Web Site.

### Exercise 4: Connecting via Client Libraries ###

In this exercise, you will learn how to use ADO.NET, ODBC, OLEDB and LINQ to SQL technologies to connect to your SQL Database and perform some simple T-SQL operations. In addition, you will see how to connect to the database from other technologies like Java and PHP.

Using Microsoft Technologies, you will see that the way in which you interact with your Windows Azure SQL Database from your applications is the same as a traditional SQL Database. The main differences between the technologies lie in the type of connection and the connection strings used to connect to Windows Azure SQL Database. After the connection is established, you can then use the appropriate inheritor of the ‘DbCommand’ to issue your commands.

<a name="Ex4Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 - Opening the Begin Solution and Exploring the Common Functionalities ####

You will test the different Microsoft technologies connecting to SQL Database and performing some tasks against a new table. To avoid spending time implementing logic that creates, inserts, queries and deletes a table, this exercise provides a begin solution that implements these common functionalities. This allows you to focus on learning how to connect to SQL Database and explore the differences between the proposed technologies. 

In this task, you will open the **ConnectDemoApp** solution and explore the **SQLDatabaseConnectionDemo** class. During the exercise, you will inherit from this class for each different implementation of a data access technology.

1. Open **Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for Desktop**.

1. Open the begin solution provided for this exercise. To do this, from the **File** menu, choose **Open Project**. In the **Open Project** dialog, navigate to **Ex4-ConnectingViaClientLibraries\Begin** inside the **Source** folder of this lab and then open the solution **Begin.sln**. A solution with the following structure should open.
	 
	![ConnectDemoAppSolutionStructure](Images/connectdemoappsolutionstructure.png?raw=true)  

	_Connect Demo App solution’s structure_ 
	 
1. As mentioned before, you will create a class per technology inheriting from the **SQLDatabaseConnectionDemo** abstract class. This class provides common functionality to perform basic operations against SQL Database using the provider that you  implement in the derived class. The table below explains each of the methods in this class to understand how it works and determine which methods you need to implement in the derived classes: 

	| **Method** | **Type** | **Description** |
	|------------|----------|-----------------|
	|CreateConnection  |Abstract|A derived class implements this method in order to create the connection according to the underlying technology.|
	|CreateCommand     |Abstract|A derived class implements this method to create a command according to the underlying technology.|
	|GetServerName     |    |Returns the server name from the data source. It is a common task required to create the connection to the database.|
	|ConnectToSQLDatabase | |Sets the connection property based on the result of the CreateConnection abstract method that will be implemented on the derived class. Executes the demo flow against the SQL Database. It gets a command from the derived class using the CreateCommand method and then executes the Execute* methods to create, fill, query and delete a demo table.|
	|ExecuteCreateDemoTableStatement||Executes a create table statement to create the "DemoTable" table.|
	|ExecuteInsertTestDataStatement||Executes an insert statement against the "DemoTable" table.|
	|ExecuteReadInsertedTestData||Executes a select statement trying to retrieve the data inserted by the previous method and calls the ReadData method to show it in the Console.|
	|ReadData          |    |Reads the data retrieved from the table and displays it in the Console.|
	|ExecuteDropDemoTable|  |Executes a delete statement removing the "DemoTable" table from the SQL Database.|

	Notice that you will only have to override the **CreateConnection** and **CreateCommand** methods on the implementation of each technology to create a connection to SQL Database successfully.

<a name="Ex4Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 - Connecting to SQL Database Using ADO.NET ####
In this task, you will create a class that inherits from the **SQLDatabaseConnectionDemo** class and implements the methods to connect to SQL Database using ADO.NET.

1. Add a new class to the project named **AdoConnectionDemo**. To do this, right-click the **ConnectDemoApp** project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Add** | **Class**. In the **Add New Item** dialog, make sure that you select the **Class** template and set the name to **AdoConnectionDemo.cs**.

1. Make sure that you have the following namespace directives at the top of the file:

	<!-- mark: 1-2-->
	````C#
	using System.Data.Common;
	using System.Data.SqlClient;
	````
 
1. Update the class definition to inherit from **SQLDatabaseConnectionDemo**. It should look like the following:
	
	<!-- mark: 1 -->
	````C#
	public class AdoConnectionDemo : SQLDatabaseConnectionDemo
	{
	}
	````
	
1. The **SQLDatabaseConnectionDemo** class delegates the connection construction to the derived class. Override the **CreateConnection** method to create a **SQLDatabaseConnection** in your **AdoConnectionDemo** class:
	
	(Code Snippet - _WindowsAzureSQLDatabase - Ex4 ADO CreateConnection - C#_)
	
	<!-- mark: 1-4-->
	````C#
	protected override DbConnection CreateConnection(string userName, string password, string dataSource, string databaseName)
	{
	  return new SqlConnection(this.CreateAdoConnectionString(userName, password, dataSource, databaseName));
	}
	````
	
1. Implement the **CreateAdoConnectionString** method used by the **CreateConnection** method. This method is responsible for building up the connection string for the ADO.NET Connection, which takes advantage of the **SqlConnectionStringBuilder** class in the underlying implementation. 
	
	(Code Snippet - _WindowsAzureSQLDatabase - Ex4 ADO CreateAdoConnectionString method - C#_)
	
	<!-- mark: 1-15-->
	````C#

	  {
	    DataSource = dataSource,
	    InitialCatalog = databaseName,
	    Encrypt = true,
	    TrustServerCertificate = false,
	    UserID = userName,
	    Password = password,
	  };
	
	  return connectionStringBuilder.ToString();
	}
	````
	
1. Override the **CreateCommand** method to create an ADO.NET command. Remember that this abstract method is called in the parent class to get the connection and execute the different SQL statement samples.
	
	(Code Snippet - _WindowsAzureSQLDatabase - Ex4 ADO CreateCommand method - C#_)
	
	<!-- mark: 1-4 -->
	````C#
	protected override DbCommand CreateCommand(DbConnection connection)
	{
	  return new SqlCommand() { Connection = connection as SqlConnection };
	}
	````
	That is all the code required to use an ADO.NET connection. Now you will include some code on the **Program.cs** file to test the connection and see how the different operations work.
1. Open the **Program.cs** file double-clicking it in the **Solution Explorer** inside the **ConnectDemoApp** project.

1. Implement the logic to create an instance of the **AdoConnectionDemo** class and execute the demo against SQL Database.
	
	(Code Snippet - _WindowsAzureSQLDatabase - Ex4 ADO demo implementation - C#_)
	
	<!-- mark: 3-8 --->
	````C#
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
	  // Invoke the ADO.NET connection demo
	  Console.WriteLine("Starting the ADO.NET Connection Demo...");
	  AdoConnectionDemo demo1 = new AdoConnectionDemo();
	  demo1.ConnectToSQLDatabase(userName, password, datasource, databaseName);
	  Console.WriteLine("Demo Complete... Press any key");
	  Console.ReadKey();
	}
	````
	
1. Locate the member variables declared immediately above method **Main** and update the placeholders with the connection information for your SQL Database.

	protected override DbConnection CreateConnection(string userName, string password, string dataSource, string databaseName)
	{
	  return new OdbcConnection(this.CreateOdbcConnectionString(userName, password, dataSource, databaseName));
	}
	````
	
1. Implement the **CreateOdbcConnectionString** method used by the **CreateConnection** method. This method is responsible for building up the ODBC Drivers connection string. The proposed implementation is using **SQL Server Native Client 11.0** as its driver. You can specify any other ODBC driver of your preference here. 
	
	(Code Snippet - _WindowsAzureSQLDatabase - Ex4 ODBC CreateOdbcConnectionString method - C#_)

#### Task 5 - Connecting to SQL Database Using Entity Framework ####
You have connected in three different ways to the database on SQL Database. The last technology that you are going to try will be **Entity Framework**. You will notice that the class implementation for this demo will not inherit from the **SQLDatabaseConnectionDemo** class because when using **Entity Framework**, you do not have to manage Connections and Commands; those are administered by the underlying technology and you do not have to worry about them.

1. Open the **App.config** file and change the connection string to point to your SQL Database, and enter the password to connect using the test user created earlier in this lab. Close the file after saving it.
	
	>**Note:** This step is required because **Entity Framework** gets the connection settings from the configuration file.

## Summary ##

In this lab, you have looked at the basics of working with Windows Azure SQL Database. If you have any SQL Server experience, you may have found the lab familiar and that is, indeed, the point. Working with SQL Database should be very familiar to anyone who has worked with SQL Server.

You learned to create new databases, logins and users for those databases. You saw that for the most part, you could simply create objects in SQL Database as you would with an on-premise SQL Server. 

In addition, you created a simple Windows Azure application that is able to consume a SQL Database. 

Finally, you saw that creating connections to SQL Database using Microsoft technologies is the same as creating connections to any normal on-premises database.
